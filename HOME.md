# Yrsa

Type family **Yrsa** is a libre type family published by [Rosetta](https://rosettatype.com) with generous financial support from Google. The fonts are going to support some 45+2 languages in Latin and Gujarati scripts in 5 weights and will be freely available from the Google Fonts directory, once it is ready. Design and production are done in-house by [Anna Giedryś](http://ancymonic.com) ([@ancymonic](http://github.com/ancymonic)) and [David Březina](http://davi.cz) ([@MrBrezina](http://github.com/MrBrezina)).

What makes Yrsa different is the design approach. It is a deliberate experiment in remixing existing typefaces to produce a new one. The Latin part of Yrsa is based on [Merriweather](http://sorkintype.com/fonts.html#mw) by Eben Sorkin. The Gujarati is based on David Březina’s [Skolar Gujarati](https://www.rosettatype.com/Skolar#gujarati).
